ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tristan Smeets.

## Recent projects:

Worked on implementing UI for an unanounced project and worked on improving their UI tool.

#### Render Engine (Feb 2020 - Jul 2021)
I made a OpenGL 3D renderer to work on my C++ and OpenGL skills. More info and code in the repository [Readme](https://github.com/TristanSmeets/Render-Engine).

#### Internship Gamelab Oost (Sep 2019 - Jan 2020): 
Worked on a serious AR game for [Roessingh Research and Development](http://www.rrd.nl/).
The game was created to help stroke patients rehabilitate by helping them practice their gross motor skills in their arms.
I was responsible for creating the Kinect implementation, UI implementation, and game design.
